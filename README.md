# Mini Project Manager (Frontend Only)

This is a clean, mobile-first UI for a mini project manager built with:
- Next.js App Router + shadcn/ui
- Redux Toolkit state (frontend only)
- Pages: Login, Register, Projects list (CRUD), Project detail (task CRUD, filter by status, sort by due date)

Colors: primary blue, neutrals (white/slate), green accent.  
No gradients. Accessible contrast.

## Notes
- This project does not implement real authentication or API calls. The Redux store seeds mock data.
- Wire your backend (Express/Next API + MongoDB + JWT) by replacing the Redux actions with async thunks that call your endpoints.
